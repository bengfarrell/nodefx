# NODEFX
Yet another Web Audio Effects library based on the Web Audio API, but this one works in Node.js using
the [node-web-audio-api library](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/node-web-audio-api/), which itself
is enabled by a Rust based Web Audio API implementation (web-audio-api-rs)[https://github.com/orottier/web-audio-api-rs/].
